        <h1>About ME?</h1>
        <img src="kevin.jpg" width = "300" height = "400"alt="picture of Kevin">
    <p> I go by the names of <strong >Kevin Mugarura Byarugaba.</strong> I am a student of Makerere University offering 
        Software Engineering(1st year). I grew up in Kampala City in a family of six kids. I went to pre school here
        -in this crazy city- for most of my 20 year old life. I am born to academic parents, most 
        of my academic life has been smooth. I wouldn't leave without two things in my life: a book and a computer.

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: -10px;"> Where does Mugarura see him self in the next ten years?</h2>
    <p>A Software Engineer finishing his masters. Accomplished some reputable projects with world organisations.</p>
   
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: -10px;">Which animal do you like and why?</h2>
    <p>A Siberian Tiger. It is a very patient and persistent animal. It lives in the worst conditions on earth yet it has
       managed to survive millions of years. It will wait for its prey in the snow for days until it is successful.
    </p>
    
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: -10px;">Which person(whether dead or alive) would love to talk to? </h2>
    <P>Pablo Escobar! No that's a joke. Muhammad Gadhafi. Seriously this time. The guy was a dreamer and executor.
        If he dreamt it then it could happen. He knew the potential of Africa. He knew his country could survive without 
        western influence and he did it. 
    </P>
